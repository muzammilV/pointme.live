    <h1>Top 10 Uses for an Online Compass</h1>
    <p>A browser-based compass is surprisingly versatile. Here are ten practical uses you might not have considered.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">

    <h2>1. 🕌 Finding Qibla Direction for Prayer</h2>
    <p>For Muslims, knowing the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca is essential for daily prayers. Our <a href="../qibla-finder.html">Qibla Finder</a> uses GPS and your phone's compass to calculate the precise bearing — no app download, no setup. Just open the browser and get your direction.</p>

    <h2>2. 🏔 Trail Orientation While Hiking</h2>
    <p>You've just left the trail to scramble up a ridge and need to know which direction leads back to camp. A quick heading check takes two seconds. The compass works offline once the page is loaded — crucial when cell signal is unreliable in the backcountry.</p>

    <h2>3. 🏠 Orienting a New Home or Apartment</h2>
    <p>Which direction does your bedroom face? East-facing rooms get morning sun; west-facing get afternoon heat. Knowing compass orientation helps with furniture placement, choosing window treatments, and planning a garden. Interior designers and architects use compass bearings routinely.</p>

    <h2>4. 🌅 Finding Sunrise and Sunset Directions</h2>
    <p>The sun rises due East and sets due West on equinoxes — but varies throughout the year. Knowing your compass heading lets you figure out whether that view from the balcony will catch the golden hour, or whether a room will be drenched in afternoon light.</p>

    <h2>5. 📡 Pointing a Satellite Dish or TV Antenna</h2>
    <p>Both satellite dishes and directional TV antennas require precise compass alignment. Installation guides specify azimuth (compass bearing) alongside elevation angle. A phone compass is accurate enough for this task and more convenient than a traditional compass in tight rooftop spaces.</p>

    <h2>6. 🚗 Dashboard Heading While Driving</h2>
    <p>Before GPS was everywhere, drivers used compass headings to confirm they were going the right way. It still works — especially on long straight roads through areas with poor GPS signal, or when you just want to confirm "yes, this road heads roughly northwest." Use our <a href="../car.html">Car Compass mode</a> for a large, readable display.</p>

    <h2>7. ⛵ Casual Boating Reference</h2>
    <p>Coastal kayakers, paddleboarders, and recreational boaters sometimes want a quick heading reference without firing up their chartplotter. A phone compass fills that gap nicely — though always carry proper marine navigation equipment on serious outings.</p>

    <h2>8. 📸 Landscape Photography Planning</h2>
    <p>Photographers planning landscape or architectural shots often need to know where the sun will be at a specific time. Apps like PhotoPills use compass bearings for planning. A quick heading check tells you which way a scene faces so you can calculate lighting conditions.</p>

    <h2>9. 🌍 Getting Oriented in an Unfamiliar City</h2>
    <p>You've just exited a subway station in an unfamiliar city with a paper map (or a screenshot) and no mobile data. A compass heading tells you which way North is so you can orient the map and walk confidently. No data required once the page is loaded.</p>

    <h2>10. 🏫 Science and Geography Education</h2>
    <p>Teachers and students can use a browser compass to demonstrate Earth's magnetic field in real time, explore magnetic declination, discuss the difference between magnetic and true North, and even build simple exercises around compass bearings. No physical compass sets needed — every student's phone works.</p>
