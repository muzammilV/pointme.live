    <h1>How to Calibrate Your Phone Compass</h1>
    <p>If your compass is spinning erratically or pointing in the wrong direction, it needs calibration. Here's exactly how to do it on both iPhone and Android.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">

    <h2>Why Calibration Is Necessary</h2>
    <p>Your phone's magnetometer is sensitive to magnetic fields from its own internal components — the speaker magnets, battery, and other electronics. These create a constant magnetic offset called <em>hard iron distortion</em>. Calibration lets the sensor firmware measure and cancel this internal interference, leaving only Earth's magnetic field to compute direction from.</p>
    <p>Calibration can drift over time, especially if you've been near strong magnetic fields or changed environments dramatically (moved from indoors to outdoors, traveled internationally, etc.).</p>

    <h2>The Figure-8 Method (Works on All Phones)</h2>
    <p>This is the universal calibration method. It works because moving through a complete figure-8 exposes all three axes of the magnetometer to the full range of magnetic field directions, giving the firmware enough data to solve for the offset correction.</p>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <div><strong>Hold your phone comfortably</strong> — face up or face forward, either way works. Move away from metal furniture and electronics.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Slowly trace a figure-8 in the air</strong> with your phone. Make the loops large — roughly 30–40cm diameter each. Don't rush.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Complete 3–5 full figure-8 cycles.</strong> Some phones complete calibration faster; you'll often see the compass stabilize mid-way through.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div><strong>Verify the reading.</strong> Point your phone toward a known direction (the sun rises in the East, sets in the West — easy daytime cross-check) and confirm the compass matches.</div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>iPhone-Specific Calibration</h2>
    <p>iOS has a built-in calibration prompt in the Compass app — a ball-rolling animation where you tilt the phone to roll a ball around a ring. This effectively exposes all axes, similar to the figure-8 method. To force this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the native <strong>Compass</strong> app (pre-installed)</li>
      <li>If calibration is needed, the rolling ball screen appears automatically</li>
      <li>Alternatively, go to <strong>Settings → Privacy → Motion & Fitness</strong> and toggle Compass access off and on — this sometimes resets the calibration state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ensure <strong>Settings → Compass → Use True North</strong> is configured as you prefer. True North requires Location Services to apply the local declination correction.</p>

    <h2>Android-Specific Calibration</h2>
    <p>Android doesn't have a single universal calibration screen — it varies by manufacturer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Samsung:</strong> Open the native Compass widget, tap the calibration icon (if visible), and follow on-screen instructions</li>
      <li><strong>Google Pixel:</strong> The figure-8 method is the standard approach</li>
      <li><strong>Most Android:</strong> Open Google Maps, tap the compass icon, and Maps will prompt calibration if needed with a figure-8 animation guide</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When Calibration Doesn't Help</h2>
    <p>If the compass remains inaccurate after multiple calibration attempts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Remove your phone case</strong>, especially if it has a magnetic latch, kickstand magnet, or card pocket with RFID shielding. These are a very common cause of persistent compass errors.</li>
      <li><strong>Move to a different location.</strong> You may be near an underground metal structure, electrical conduit, or a device with a strong magnetic field.</li>
      <li><strong>Check for software issues.</strong> Restart the phone and try again.</li>
      <li><strong>Consider hardware damage.</strong> Dropping a phone or exposing it to a powerful magnet can permanently damage the magnetometer. If calibration never works, this may be the cause — some third-party repair shops can replace the sensor.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="info-box">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> After calibrating, test your compass against the sunset/sunrise direction. The sun rises within a few degrees of East in most seasons, making it a convenient real-world reference.
