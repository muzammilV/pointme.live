  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>PointMe.live ("we", "our", or "the Site") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect (very little), what we do with it, and your rights. If you have questions, contact us at <a href="./contact.html">our contact page</a>.</p>

  <h2>1. Sensor Data (Compass & Location)</h2>
  <p>The compass functionality on this site uses your device's orientation sensor (DeviceOrientationEvent API) to display a heading. The Qibla Finder uses your GPS location to calculate direction toward Mecca.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit your compass heading data.</strong> All orientation calculations happen locally in your browser.</li>
    <li><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit your GPS coordinates.</strong> Location data used by the Qibla Finder is processed entirely on your device and is never sent to our servers.</li>
    <li>Sensor access requires your explicit permission via your browser's permission prompt. You may deny permission at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
  <p>Like most websites, our hosting provider may automatically collect standard server log data when you visit, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>IP address (used for analytics and abuse prevention)</li>
    <li>Browser type and version</li>
    <li>Pages visited and time spent</li>
    <li>Referring URL</li>
    <li>Device type (mobile/desktop)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used solely for understanding aggregate traffic patterns and improving the site. It is not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>3. Cookies and Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may use analytics tools (such as Google Analytics) to understand how visitors use the site. These tools use cookies — small text files stored in your browser. Analytics data is aggregated and anonymized.</p>
  <p>We may also display advertising via <strong>Google AdSense</strong>. AdSense uses cookies to serve relevant ads based on your browsing history. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads based on your visits to this and other sites. You can opt out of personalized advertising at <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" rel="noopener" target="_blank">google.com/settings/ads</a>.</p>
  <p>By using this site, you consent to cookies as described above. You can control cookie behavior through your browser settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any contact information unless you voluntarily submit it via our contact form</li>
    <li>We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
    <li>We do not build user profiles or track individuals across sessions</li>
    <li>We do not use your compass bearing or GPS coordinates for any purpose other than local on-device computation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Contact Form Data</h2>
  <p>If you submit our contact form, your name, email address, and message are used solely to respond to your inquiry. This data is not shared with third parties and is retained only as long as necessary to address your request.</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>This site is served over HTTPS. While we take reasonable precautions to secure any data transmitted to us, no internet transmission is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
